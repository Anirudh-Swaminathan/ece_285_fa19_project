This folder is to test out some small code examples to learn and understand the concepts that are used for this project

The contents of this folder are as follows.
1. min_char_rnn.py - This file contains code to run and train a minimal vanilla RNN on characters. The original code is found [here](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086).
2. input.txt - This file is the input to the RNN model that we shall train.

[This](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) is the excellent blog-post by @karpathy that points to this code. This blog post explains RNNs in a beautiful and succint way.
